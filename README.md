# Iterative Spectral Method ( ISM ) 

Iterative Spectral Method (ISM) is an optimization technique that could be used to solve many HSIC related problems with a Gaussian Kernel. This repository contains an implemented ISM for Kernel Dimensionality Alternative Clustering (KDAC). KDAC was originally published in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
