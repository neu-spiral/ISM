# Iterative Spectral Method ( ISM ) 

Iterative Spectral Method (ISM) is an optimization technique that could be used to solve many HSIC related problems with a Gaussian Kernel. This repository contains an implemented ISM for Kernel Dimensionality Alternative Clustering (KDAC). KDAC was originally published in Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. ISM was originally published in AIStat 2017.



## Getting Started

The code is written with python2.7 on a Mint Linux Machine version 17.1. 
The following libraries must be included.

  1. numpy
  2. matplotlib
  3. sklearn
  4. scipy
  
Note: The GPU version is current NOT supported in this release. 

The experiments should run by uncommenting the appropriate experiment within main.py and running the file.
